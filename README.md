### CyprainChidozie

I'm Cyprain from Czech Republic, and I do content on Design and Development. I really enjoy learning langauges and frameworks like .NET, React, Angular,  Django, Express.js, , ASP.net, Spring Boot and the likes. My current focus is mainly on Backend development and I spend most of my days learning about latest technologies in this aspect.
